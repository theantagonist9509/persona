## 💡 **Smart Inferencing System for Detecting Potential Disorders**  
![Inferencer Flowchart](Flowcharts/inferencer-flowchart.png)

### ⚙️ **How It Works**  
✅ The inferencing system **analyzes each user message** to detect potential mental health issues.  
✅ Utilizes a **bi-agent system** to enhance prediction accuracy.  
✅ The platform can **classify each message** into one of the following categories:  
   - **Normal**  
   - **Eating Disorders**  
   - **Addiction**  
   - **Emotional Issues**  
   - **ADHD**  
   - **Anxiety**  
   - **Autism**  
   - **Bipolar Disorder**  
   - **Depression**  
   - **Loneliness**  
   - **PTSD**  
   - **Schizophrenia**  
   - **Extreme Issues**  

✅ This system **runs in the background** and provides **valuable insights for counselors** to better understand user concerns.

## 🎯 Profile Generation Pipeline
![Profile Generation Pipeline](Flowcharts/profiler-flowchart.png)

We implement a precise yet efficient user profiling system for the therapeutic chatbot, utilizing a unique citation generation mechanism.

### 🚀 Key Features:
✅ Retrieves unprofiled user messages from the MySQL database

✅ Updates existing user profiles with information from unprocessed messages using a summarization agent (LLM)

✅ Implements a unique citation generation mechanism that employs semantic similarity scores to propagate citations across profile updates over time

### 💡 Citation Generation Mechanism:
1. Summarizer Agent:

   ✅ Employs a ChatOllama model to summarize user messages while augmenting them with the existing profile
   
   ✅ Generates concise, non-repetitive summaries of all user information till-date
   

3. Cosine Similarity (using ChromaDB):

   ✅ Uses HuggingFace embeddings (sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2) for semantic similarity scoring
   
   ✅ Stores embeddings from both the persistent profile, and the unprofiled messages in in-memory ChromaDB collections for efficient querying
   
   ✅ Propagates chat message citations by finding the most similar messages to each profile point
   

### ⭐ Usage

✅ Automatically updates user profiles based on new, unprofiled messages

✅ Marks profiled messages in the database to prevent redundant updates

✅ Can be run as a standalone script to update profiles for all users
