## **Smart Inferencing System for Detecting Potential Disorders**  

### **How It Works**  
1️⃣ The inferencing system **analyzes each user message** to detect potential mental health issues.  
2️⃣ Utilizes a **bi-agent system** to enhance prediction accuracy.  
3️⃣ The platform can **classify each message** into one of the following categories:  
   - **Normal**  
   - **Eating Disorders**  
   - **Addiction**  
   - **Emotional Issues**  
   - **ADHD**  
   - **Anxiety**  
   - **Autism**  
   - **Bipolar Disorder**  
   - **Depression**  
   - **Loneliness**  
   - **PTSD**  
   - **Schizophrenia**  
   - **Extreme Issues**  

4️⃣ This system **runs in the background** and provides **valuable insights for counselors** to better understand user concerns.

## Profile Generation Pipeline

We implement a precise yet efficient user profiling system for the therapeutic chatbot, utilizing a unique citation generation mechanism.

### Key Features:
- Retrieves unprofiled user messages from the MySQL database
- Updates existing user profiles with information from unprocessed messages using a summarization agent (LLM)
- Implements a unique citation generation mechanism that employs semantic similarity scores to propagate citations across profile updates over time

### Citation Generation Mechanism:
1. Summarizer Agent:
   - Employs a ChatOllama model to summarize user messages while augmenting them with the existing profile
   - Generates concise, non-repetitive summaries of all user information till-date

2. Cosine Similarity (using ChromaDB):
   - Uses HuggingFace embeddings (sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2) for semantic similarity scoring
   - Stores embeddings from both the persistent profile, and the unprofiled messages in in-memory ChromaDB collections for efficient querying
   - Propagates chat message citations by finding the most similar messages to each profile point

### Usage
- Automatically updates user profiles based on new, unprofiled messages
- Marks profiled messages in the database to prevent redundant updates
- Can be run as a standalone script to update profiles for all users
